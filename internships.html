                    This internship was part of my final school project. I utilized a combination of my knowledge about Java backend and Next.js frontend. Additionally, I learned how to set up CI/CD on my own. 
                    I worked within a large company environment, employing Scrum and Agile methods. The project involved creating a program to calculate energy prices and using weather APIs to predict when solar panels would produce the most electricity to optimize their use.

                    During this internship at a small company that sells health products, I learned to work collaboratively in a smaller team with diverse tasks. I was primarily responsible for creating a new website to host a product catalog. 
                    Additionally, I contributed to marketing strategies for the site and resolved various IT problems, as I was the only team member with technical expertise.
