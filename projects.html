                    Critter Chaos is a thrilling couch co-op tag game developed during a school hackathon. In this game, two players take on the roles of a cat and a mouse, with the cat using special abilities to catch the mouse. The roles swap after each round, keeping the gameplay fresh and engaging. Created within a 48-hour timeframe by a team of three students, including myself as a programmer, this project showcases rapid development and teamwork skills.

                    As my final assignment for graphics programming, I developed a Vulkan renderer capable of simulating complex particle systems using NVIDIA PhysX. This solo project pushed the limits of my skills in graphics programming and physics simulations, resulting in a highly optimized particle simulator that handles thousands of particles interacting in real-time, showcasing my ability to tackle advanced technical challenges.

                    Familiar is a couch co-op zombie survival game developed over a semester by a team of students. The game features a unique tether mechanic that forces two players to stay close and work together to survive waves of zombies. My role in this project was to implement the tether mechanic and ensure smooth, cooperative gameplay, making this a challenging and rewarding experience in game development.
